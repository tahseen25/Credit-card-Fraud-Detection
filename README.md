Credit Card Fraud Detection
Overview
This project aims to build a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. The dataset used for this project contains transaction details, and the model is trained to distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent transactions.

Dataset
The dataset is available at link-to-dataset (if public) or describe where it can be obtained. It contains the following columns:

Time: Number of seconds elapsed between this transaction and the first transaction in the dataset.
V1, V2, ..., V28: Principal components obtained with PCA.
Amount: Transaction amount.
Class: Target variable (0 for legitimate transactions, 1 for fraudulent transactions).

Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/credit-card-fraud-detection.git
cd credit-card-fraud-detection
Create a virtual environment and activate it:
bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the required dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Ensure you have the dataset file in the project directory.
Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to train and evaluate the model:
bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection.ipynb
or
bash
Copy code
python credit_card_fraud_detection.py

Model Training
Load and explore the dataset.
Preprocess the data, handle missing values, and balance the dataset.
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Train a logistic regression model using the training data.

Model Evaluation
Evaluate the model on both training and testing datasets.
Calculate accuracy scores and other performance metrics.

Visualization
Visualize the distribution of classes before and after under-sampling.
Analyze feature distributions for normal and fraudulent transactions.
Visualize model performance metrics.

Results
The model achieved an accuracy of 94% on the training set and Y% on the test set.
Key insights and findings from the data and model.
